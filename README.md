3. Open SQL Server Express and run the "create_db.sql" file that can be found in the **database** folder in the repository

## Requirements ##

This skills assessment is based on your ability to build out a system that can meet the requirements listed below.  

* An internal employee directory so all of our employees can search our database of 30,000 employees
* We would like regular employees to be able to log in and be able to search the database
* We would like HR representatives to be able to add/edit/delete employees
* A typical directory entry has the following information:
** Name
** Job Title
** Location
** Email
** Phone Number(s)

## Goal of this Skills Assessment ##

The goal of this skills assessment is to understand how you solve problems. 

It should also be noted that EVERYTHING is in scope.  This repo is meant as a starting point, if you think the code in this repo is junk feel free to rewrite it or ignore it altogether.  We want to see the types of patterns/tools/solutions that you would typically bring into a project that you are working on.

## Demo Meeting ##

After completing the assessment, you'll meet with two Headspring engineers virtually to demo your code as well as answer any questions about design choices you made in your solution.
